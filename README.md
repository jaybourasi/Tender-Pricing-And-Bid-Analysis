## Tender Price Analysis For Railroad Equipment Supplier
The project focused on addressing the issue of losing tenders to competitors, which was leading to significant revenue loss for a leading railroad equipment supplier. To improve bid success, we analyzed historical tender data and refined pricing strategies. The data was collected and preprocessed using SQL and Excel, followed by in-depth analysis with Power BI to optimize bidding strategies. This approach resulted in a 10% increase in bid success rate and improved profit margins by 5-10% through more effective pricing strategies.
